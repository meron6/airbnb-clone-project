## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
The main goal of the UI/UX design is to provide a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience that mirrors modern booking platforms like Airbnb.  
The design should ensure that users can:
- Quickly browse available properties.
- View property details with clear information and images.
- Complete a simple checkout process with minimal steps.

### Key Features to be Implemented
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Search & Filtering:** Allow users to filter properties by price, location, and availability.  
- **Image Galleries:** High-quality visuals for property listings and details.  
- **Booking Workflow:** Streamlined checkout process to reduce friction.  
- **Consistency:** Uniform styling across pages using TailwindCSS components.  

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page Name                | Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays all available properties with thumbnails, price, location, and a quick “View Details” option. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Provides detailed property information including description, amenities, photo gallery, reviews, and a “Book Now” button. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Collects user booking details (dates, guests, payment method) with a straightforward form and confirmation page. |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A user-friendly design is critical in a booking system because:
- It **reduces user frustration**, ensuring visitors can easily find and book properties.  
- It **increases conversion rates**, as a seamless design encourages users to complete bookings.  
- It **builds trust**, as a clean and consistent interface assures users of a professional and reliable platform.  
- It **enhances accessibility**, making the system usable by a wide range of users, including those with different devices or technical skills.

- **Accessibility:** Proper typography and color contrast improve readability.
