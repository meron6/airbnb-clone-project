## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
The main goal of the UI/UX design is to provide a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly experience that mirrors modern booking platforms like Airbnb.  
The design should ensure that users can:
- Quickly browse available properties.
- View property details with clear information and images.
- Complete a simple checkout process with minimal steps.

### Key Features to be Implemented
- **Responsive Layout:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Search & Filtering:** Allow users to filter properties by price, location, and availability.  
- **Image Galleries:** High-quality visuals for property listings and details.  
- **Booking Workflow:** Streamlined checkout process to reduce friction.  
- **Consistency:** Uniform styling across pages using TailwindCSS components.  

### Primary Pages Overview
